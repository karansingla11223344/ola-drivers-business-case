Ola is one of the leading ride-hailing companies in India, connecting millions of passengers with drivers across multiple cities. One of the major challenges Ola faces is driver retention.

In this project, we analyze driver-level data from 2019–2020 to predict whether a driver is likely to continue or leave the platform. By performing exploratory data analysis and building machine learning models, we aim to identify key factors influencing driver attrition.

The insights from this analysis can help Ola design data-driven retention strategies, improve driver engagement, and reduce churn.
